# Fortune Chaser, an 8-bit Java Game

This game started as a basic dot-collecting project for an object-oriented programming course I took in my second year. Later, I decided to expand it into a full-fledged game with original music, maps, and unique art style. Though it's still a work in progress, Iâ€™m proud of the features it has developed considering it was my first computer science project. The visuals are a mix of pixel art that I created (like the trees and grass) along with some assets sourced online. The goal of the game is simple: collect all the fortune cookies and receive its fortunes.
